this is the code for a smart pill box first we will have a camera, a weight sensor and a servo motor attached to raspberry pi. first raspberry pi will capture images from the camera and send it to the server. the server(here, laptop), will have a trained CNN model, trained with all the pill images, which will detect the pill, and even what type of pill it is. then even the weight sensor will send weight it measures. everytime a patient is supposed to take tablet, the weight is measured, camera checks if tablet is correct and print it, and servo motor rotates(opening the box), then after 5 mins, if pill is taken then the servo motor will close. if the pill isnt taken(weight is recorded by weight sensors and camera captures pill), notification is sent to caretakers e mail..
